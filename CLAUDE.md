# Claude Configuration

> **Note on paths.** The `.claude/` tree this file refers to is developer tooling and is
> no longer carried in this repository — it lives one level up, in the shared workspace
> root alongside the sibling `lavs-ee` and `lavs-site` checkouts, so a single copy serves
> all three. Claude Code discovers it by walking up from the working directory, so the
> references below resolve normally in a configured workspace. They will not resolve in a
> bare clone of this repository, which is expected: the agent configuration is not part of
> the product.

**Agent Count:** 24 primary agents  
**Persona:** Software Engineer

## Core Conventions

**ALWAYS load first, before any agent:**

```
.claude/conventions/core/general.md
```

This file contains:
- System startup checklist (branch check, session management)
- Feature branch naming conventions
- General development rules
- Session management protocol
- Core conventions (repository structure, error handling, imports)

## Agent Registry

Match the user's request to **ONE** agent and load **ONLY** that file.

## Instructions

1. **Load core conventions:**
   ```
   Read: .claude/conventions/core/general.md
   ```

2. **Analyze the user's request** and match to ONE agent using the routing rules above

3. **Load that agent's file:**
   ```
   Read: .claude/agents/{selected-agent}.md
   ```

4. **Follow the agent's instructions** - The agent file will tell you:
   - What workflow to load
   - What language conventions to load
   - What subagents to load
   - What skills to load
   
5. **Do NOT load anything else** until the agent file explicitly instructs you to

## Notes

- Each agent file is self-contained with all necessary references
- Language conventions are loaded by workflows, not upfront
- Skills are loaded on-demand when workflows require them
- Subagents are loaded only when the primary agent delegates to them
